# personal_task_manager

Flutter simple project which allows you to add, edit and delete tasks. Additionaly it charges the actual weather data depending on your location.

UI implemented by figma project created by Jenelle Miller. [LINK](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1175913608782916573/todo-mobile-app-community)

In the project I used MVVM pattern, build the structure such as:

lib/
├── models/
├── services/
├── viewmodels/
├── views/
├── widgets/
└── main.dart
